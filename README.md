2 python3 Blender 2.83 (and maybe newer) addons for Shift 2 .meb meshes and positions, port of [this 3DSMax addon by Chipicao and vagos21](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/kottons_chop_shop/ti-scp-ti-sms-model-importer-t3217.html).

Wrote it for myself just to look at car meshes in Blender, so it lacks many functions of original 3DSMax addon. Has correct UV-mapping and batch .meb import from folder.

VHF addon rotates and moves already imported meshes with proper names in selected collection 'Coll'
