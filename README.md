2 python3 Blender addons for Shift 2 .meb meshes and positions, port of [this 3DSMax addon by Chipicao and vagos21](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/kottons_chop_shop/ti-scp-ti-sms-model-importer-t3217.html).

wrote it for myself just to look at car meshes in Blender, so it lacks many functions of original 3DSMax addon.

vhf addon rotates and moves already imported meshes with proper names in selected collection 'Coll'
